Variables consist of a simple structure following: datatype name = value
You can then later reference these saved values for use in programming

An 'int' is a whole number, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. 
A 'string' is a sequence of characters, like ""Hello World"", ""I am a string"", and ""C# is awesome"". 
A 'float' is a decimal number, like 1.234, 5.678, and 9.101112. 
A 'bool' is a true or false value, like true and false.

int age = 32;
string name = ""Jesper"";
float awesomeLevel = 99.9f;
<bool TooCoolForSchool = false;
