    Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining their structure and behavior.
    Members: Include fields, properties, methods, constructors, and events.
    Access Modifiers: Control visibility and accessibility (e.g., public, private).
    Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
    Encapsulation: Combines data and behavior within a class while controlling access.
    Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details, exposing only essential features.
    Static Members: Belong to the class itself rather than instances.
    Classes are fundamental for organizing code in C#, promoting reusability and maintainability.
